# backbone.js

In this project under the guidance of Lynda tutorials I have learned about backbone.js. Backbone.js is the key to keeping
your JavaScript code neat, and seperating your markup from the data powering your web applications. It has fantastic server-
side capabilities, this project focuses on the most relevant features for front-end developers and web designers that 
want to learn how to build out their web pages and keep their code organized, move away from the DOM, and use Backbone's useful
JavaScript library. I learned how to use models and collections to manage my data, and display it on my web page with views.
Then use events and routers to create navigational logic in my web app.
